# Group 1 Project 4 - 

## 

### Introduction
Problem Statement:
VinoVista, a renowned winery, is committed to producing consistently exceptional wines. However, they have observed variability in the quality of their white wine batches. To address this challenge, VinoVista seeks a predictive model that can accurately assess the quality of wine batches based on their chemical properties before bottling.
Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting wine quality on a scale of 0-10. This model will utilize a dataset containing various chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, pH, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, sulfates, and alcohol content.
